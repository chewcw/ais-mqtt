Basically, the FFT length
if sample_rate = 1000  # Hz
duration = 1        # seconds
N = sample_rate * duration  # Total number of samples (FFT length)

Then, to calculate frequency resolution
frequency_resolution = sample_rate / N
10997 x 4 = Total Acc(x);
10997 x 4 = Total Acc(y);
10997 x 4 = Total Acc(z);
10997 x 4 = Total Vec(x);
10997 x 4 = Total Vec(y);
10997 x 4 = Total Vec(z);

The relationship between Overall Amplitude (OA) and ISO 10816-3 is significant in the context of vibration monitoring for industrial machinery. 

- **Overall Amplitude (OA)** refers to the total vibration level measured, which can indicate the health of a machine. It is typically expressed in terms of velocity (e.g., mm/s or inches/sec).
- **ISO 10816-3** provides guidelines for evaluating vibration levels specifically for industrial machines with power above 15 kW and operating speeds between 120 and 15,000 RPM. This standard categorizes machines into different groups based on their size and power, outlining acceptable vibration levels for each group.
- The standard defines four zones of vibration severity: Zone A (green) for newly commissioned machines, Zone B (yellow) for unrestricted operation, Zone C (orange) for restricted operation, and Zone D (red) indicating potential damage. These zones help assess OA values against established thresholds to determine machine condition and maintenance needs.

In summary, OA is a critical measurement that is assessed using the criteria outlined in ISO 10816-3 to ensure the reliability and safety of industrial equipment.

Overall amplitude vibration measurement data typically includes readings from three axes: **X, Y, and Z**. Each axis corresponds to a different direction of vibration, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of mechanical movement. Here are the key points regarding these measurements:

- **X-Axis**: Measures lateral vibrations, indicating side-to-side movements.
- **Y-Axis**: Captures vertical vibrations, reflecting up-and-down motions.
- **Z-Axis**: Records axial vibrations, which represent forward and backward movements.

These measurements are crucial for diagnosing equipment health and identifying potential issues in rotating machinery. By analyzing the amplitude data from all three axes, engineers can obtain a complete picture of the vibration behavior and make informed maintenance decisions to prevent failures and optimize performance.
